\arguments{
\item{data}{Data.frame or data.table containing the analysis dataset.}

\item{outcome}{Character string specifying the outcome variable name.}

\item{predictors}{Character vector of predictor variable names to analyze.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying variable selection strategy:
"screen" (univariable to multivariable based on p-value threshold),
"all" (all predictors in both analyses), or
"custom" (all in univariable, selected in multivariable). Default is "screen".}

\item{multi_predictors}{Character vector of predictors for multivariable
model when method is "custom". Default is NULL.}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric p-value threshold for variable selection when
method is "screen". Default is 0.05.}

\item{columns}{Character string specifying which columns to display:
"both", "uni", or "multi". Default is "both".}

\item{model_type}{Character string: "glm", "lm", "coxph", or "clogit".
Default is "glm".}

\item{family}{For GLM models, the error distribution and link function.
Default is "binomial".}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric confidence level for intervals. Default is 0.95.}

\item{add_reference_rows}{Logical. If TRUE, includes reference category rows.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_n_events}{Character vector specifying which optional columns to display.
Options: "n", "events" (or "Events"). Default is c("n", "events") for 
survival/logistic models, "n" only for other models. Set to NULL to hide
these columns entirely.}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying decimal places for effect estimates.
Default is 2.}

\item{digits_p}{Integer specifying decimal places for p-values.
Default is 3.}

\item{var_labels}{Named character vector for display labels. Names match
predictors, values are labels. Default is NULL.}

\item{metrics}{Character specification for statistics: "effect" (OR/HR/estimate
with CI), "p" (p-value only), or "both" (default).}

\item{return_type}{Character string: "table" (formatted results), "model"
(multivariable model only), or "both" (list with table and model).
Default is "table".}

\item{keep_models}{Logical. If TRUE, stores univariable model objects.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to model fitting functions.}
}
\value{
A data.table with formatted results (when return_type is "table"),
  a model object (when "model"), or a list with both (when "both").
  The table includes variable, group, sample sizes, and effect/p-value
  columns as requested. Includes attributes for outcome, model_type,
  method, columns, model (if fitted), and n_multi.
}
\description{
Executes a comprehensive regression analysis workflow including univariable
screening, automatic or manual variable selection, and multivariable modeling.
Supports multiple model types with publication-ready output formatting.
}
\details{
The function implements a complete regression workflow:

1. Univariable screening: Each predictor is tested individually against
   the outcome using the specified model type.
   
2. Variable selection: Based on the method parameter, variables are selected
   for multivariable analysis.
   
3. Multivariable modeling: Selected variables are combined in a single model.

4. Output formatting: Results are formatted for publication with appropriate
   effect measures (OR for logistic, HR for Cox, estimates for linear).

The automatic p-value threshold screening (method = "screen") helps identify
potentially important predictors while reducing multicollinearity. The custom
method allows for theory-driven model building.
