\description{
A simulated dataset from a hypothetical multi-center oncology clinical trial
comparing two experimental drugs against control. Designed to demonstrate
the full capabilities of descriptive and regression analysis functions.
}
\details{
This dataset includes realistic correlations between variables:
- Survival is worse with higher stage, ECOG, age, and biomarker_a
- Treatment effects show Drug B > Drug A > Control
- Approximately 2\% of values are missing at random
- Median follow-up is approximately 30 months
