\title{Convert Model Object to Data Table}
\usage{
m2dt(
  model,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  keep_qc_stats = TRUE,
  terms_to_exclude = "(Intercept)",
  add_reference_rows = TRUE,
  reference_label = "reference"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object. Supported classes include glm (generalized
linear models), lm (linear models), coxph (Cox proportional hazards),
clogit (conditional logistic), coxme (mixed effects Cox), and glmer
(generalized linear mixed effects). Also accepts models wrapped with mmodel().}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric confidence level for confidence intervals. Must be
between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95 (95\% CI).}

\item{keep_qc_stats}{Logical. If TRUE, includes model quality statistics such as
AIC, BIC, R-squared, concordance, and model fit tests. These appear as 
additional columns in the output. Default is TRUE.}

\item{terms_to_exclude}{Character vector of term names to exclude from output.
Useful for removing intercepts or other unwanted parameters. Default is
"(Intercept)".}

\item{add_reference_rows}{Logical. If TRUE, adds rows for reference categories
of factor variables with appropriate labels and baseline values (OR/HR = 1,
Estimate = 0). Default is TRUE.}

\item{reference_label}{Character string used to label reference category rows
in the output. Default is "reference".}
}
\value{
A data.table containing extracted model information with the following
  standard columns:
  - model_scope: Univariable (unadjusted) or multivariable (adjusted) model
  - model_type: Type of regression model
  - variable: Variable summarized
  - group: Group summarized
  - n: Sample size
  - events: Number of events (for survival/logistic models)
  - coefficient: Raw coefficient estimate
  - se: Standard error
  - OR/HR/RR/Estimate: Effect estimate (type depends on model)
  - CI_lower, CI_upper: Confidence interval bounds
  - statistic: Test statistic (z or t value)
  - p_value: P-value for coefficient test
  - sig: Significance markers (*** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05)
  - sig_binary: Logical indicator for p<0.05
  
  Additional quality control columns when keep_qc_stats = TRUE vary by model type:
  - GLM: AIC, BIC, deviance, null_deviance, c_statistic (logistic)
  - LM: R2, adj_R2, sigma, df_residual
  - Cox: concordance, rsq, logtest_stat, wald_test, score_test
  
  The output includes attributes:
  - model_class: The class of the input model
  - model_family: The family for GLM models
  - conf_level: The confidence level used
}
\description{
Extracts coefficients, confidence intervals, and comprehensive model statistics 
from fitted regression models and converts them to a standardized data.table 
format suitable for further analysis or publication.
