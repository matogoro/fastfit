\usage{
uscreen(
  data,
  outcome,
  predictors,
  model_type = "glm",
  family = "binomial",
  p_threshold = 1,
  conf_level = 0.95,
  add_reference_rows = TRUE,
  show_n_events = c("n", "events"),
  digits = 2,
  digits_p = 3,
  var_labels = NULL,
  keep_models = FALSE,
  exponentiate = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table containing the analysis dataset.}

\item{outcome}{Character string specifying the outcome variable name. For survival
analysis, use Surv() syntax (e.g., "Surv(time, status)").}

\item{predictors}{Character vector of predictor variable names to screen.}

\item{model_type}{Character string specifying the regression model type.
Options: "glm" (generalized linear model), "lm" (linear model),
"coxph" (Cox proportional hazards), "clogit" (conditional logistic).
Default is "glm".}

\item{family}{For GLM models, the error distribution family. Options include
"binomial" (logistic regression), "poisson" (count data), "gaussian" (normal),
"Gamma", etc. See \code{\link[stats]{family}}. Default is "binomial".}

\item{p_threshold}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 for filtering results by p-value.
Only predictors with p <= threshold are returned. Default is 1 (no filtering).}

\item{conf_level}{Numeric confidence level for confidence intervals. Must be
between 0 and 1. Default is 0.95 (95 percent CI).}

\item{add_reference_rows}{Logical. If TRUE, adds rows for reference categories
of factor variables with baseline values (OR/HR = 1). Default is TRUE.}

\item{show_n_events}{Character vector specifying which optional columns to display.
Options: "n", "events" (or "Events"). Default is c("n", "events") for 
survival/logistic models, "n" only for other models. Set to NULL to hide
these columns entirely.}

\item{digits}{Integer specifying decimal places for effect estimates (OR, HR, etc).
Default is 2.}

\item{digits_p}{Integer specifying decimal places for p-values. Values less than
10^(-digits_p) display as "< 0.001" etc. Default is 3.}

\item{var_labels}{Named character vector for custom variable labels. Names should
match predictor names, values are display labels. Default is NULL.}

\item{keep_models}{Logical. If TRUE, stores all fitted model objects in the output.
This can consume significant memory for large datasets or many predictors.
Models are accessible via attr(result, "models"). Default is FALSE.}

\item{exponentiate}{Logical. Whether to exponentiate coefficients. Default is NULL,
which automatically displays exponentiated coefficients for logistic/Poisson/Cox
regression models and raw coefficients for log-link or linear regression models.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying model fitting functions
(e.g., weights, subset, na.action).}
}
\value{
A data.table with class "uscreen_result" containing formatted results:
  \item{Variable}{Predictor name (or custom label if provided)}
  \item{Group}{Factor level or statistic type for continuous variables}
  \item{n}{Sample size}
  \item{events}{Number of events (for survival/logistic models)}
  \item{Univariable OR/HR/RR (95 percent CI)}{Formatted effect size with confidence interval}
  \item{p-value}{Formatted p-value}
  
  The returned object includes attributes:
  \item{raw_data}{Unformatted numeric results for further analysis}
  \item{models}{List of fitted model objects (if keep_models = TRUE)}
  \item{outcome}{The outcome variable name}
  \item{model_type}{The type of regression model used}
}
\description{
Performs univariable regression analyses for multiple predictors against a single
outcome, returning publication-ready formatted results. Each predictor is tested
independently in its own model.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each predictor, fitting a separate univariable
model for each. This is useful for:
\itemize{
  \item Initial variable screening before multivariable modeling
  \item Understanding crude (unadjusted) associations
  \item Identifying multicollinearity issues
  \item Variable selection for further analysis
}

For factor variables with add_reference_rows = TRUE, the reference category
is shown with OR/HR = 1.00 (Reference) and no p-value. P-values are displayed
only for non-reference categories.

The formatted output is ready for export via tbl2pdf(), tbl2tex(), or tbl2html().
