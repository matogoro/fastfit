* Summary

~fastfit~ is a statistical modeling toolkit built on ~data.table~ for efficient regression workflows.

This package provides ready-made functions designed to streamline the path from descriptive analysis, to regression modeling, to publication-ready tables and visualizations.  These functions are intended to run efficiently in R with minimal dependencies and unified outputs.

Currently, this package supports GLM, Cox, and mixed models.  Additional models and visualizations are planned for the future.

* Function list

This package currently focuses on two points of entry: the ~desctbl()~ and ~fastfit()~ functions.  These meta-functions provide an easy way to incorporate standard summary and regression workflows into a single function for convenience.

** Main functions

- ~desctbl()~: Creates a summary table for descriptive statistics within a given dataset.  Can be customized to include comparison /p/-values, "total" columns, missing values, etc.  [PENDING]
- ~fastfit()~: Creates a regression table for predictive statistics within a given dataset.  Can be customized to perform a univariable screen, generate downstream multivariable analyses, etc.

** Ancillary functions

- ~uscreen()~: Performs univariable regression analysis for multiple predictors against a single outcome, returning standardized results in ~data.table~ format.
- ~mmodel()~: Provides a unified interface for fitting various types of regression models with consistent syntax across different model types (GLM, Cox, mixed effects, etc.), returning standardized results in ~data.table~ format.
- ~m2dt()~: Extracts coefficients, confidence intervals, and model statistics from fitted models and converts them to a standardized ~data.table~ format.
- ~cmodels()~: Fits multiple multivariable models with different predictor sets and combines results in standardized ~data.table~ format for easy comparison.
- ~setlabels()~: Assigns labels to objects using ~setattr()~.

** Visualizations

- ~glmforest()~: Creates a combined table/forest plot for generalized linear models
- ~coxforest()~: Creates a combined table/forest plot for Cox proportional hazards models

* Changelog

*Version 0.1.0 (2025-09-23):* Initial commit

* Acknowledgements

This package is heavily inspired by the ~finalfit~ package, from which it derives its core concept.

This package also draws heavily from the ~arsenal~ package for descriptive tables.
