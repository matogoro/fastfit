* Summary

~fastfit~ is a statistical modeling toolkit built on ~data.table~ for efficient regression workflows.

This package provides ready-made functions designed to streamline the path from descriptive analysis, to regression modeling, to publication-ready tables and visualizations.  These functions are intended to run efficiently in R with minimal dependencies and standardized outputs.

Currently, this package supports GLM, Cox, and mixed models.  Additional models and visualizations are planned for the future.

* Function list

This package currently focuses on two main points of entry: the ~desctbl()~ and ~fastfit()~ functions.  These meta-functions provide an easy way to incorporate standard summary and regression workflows into a single function for speed and convenience.

** Main functions

- ~desctbl()~: Creates a summary table for descriptive statistics within a given dataset.  Can be modified to include comparison /p/-values, "total" columns, missing values, etc.
- ~fastfit()~: Creates a regression table for predictive statistics within a given dataset.  Can be modified to perform a univariable screen, generate downstream multivariable analyses, etc.

** Visualization functions

- ~glmforest()~: Creates a combined table/forest plot for generalized linear models
- ~coxforest()~: Creates a combined table/forest plot for Cox proportional hazards models

** Ancillary functions

- ~uscreen()~: The first half of ~fastfit()~.  Performs univariable regression analysis for multiple predictors against a single outcome, returning standardized results in ~data.table~ format.
- ~fit()~: The second half of ~fastfit()~.  Provides a unified interface for fitting various types of regression models with consistent syntax across different model types (GLM, Cox, mixed effects, etc.), returning standardized results in ~data.table~ format.
- ~m2dt()~: Extracts coefficients, confidence intervals, and model statistics from fitted models and converts them to a standardized ~data.table~ format.
- ~compfit()~: Compares results for multiple multivariable models.
- ~setlabels()~: Assigns labels to objects using ~setattr()~.

* Changelog

*v0.3.1 (2025-10-02):* Fixes for unknown/missing rows, reporting of ranges, and non-grouped tables in ~desctbl()~ 

*v0.3.0 (2025-09-30):* Edits to ~desctbl()~ and ~fastfit()~, addition of "raw data" outputs, expanded documentation

*v0.2.1 (2025-09-26):* Formatting edits

*v0.2.0 (2025-09-26):* Added ~desctbl()~ function and documentation

*v0.1.0 (2025-09-23):* Initial commit

* Acknowledgements

This package is heavily inspired by the ~finalfit~ package, from which it derives its core concept.

This package also adapts several concepts from the ~arsenal~ package for descriptive tables.
